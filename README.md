# Dynamic Pricing Optimization for Retail Stores

## Introduction
In this notebook, we aim to develop a **dynamic pricing model** to optimize item prices at a retail store. The objective is to **maximize revenue** while ensuring our prices remain competitive in the market. This involves analyzing sales data, understanding the impact of pricing strategies, and leveraging competitor pricing and market trends.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset provides comprehensive pricing information for various items sold in a retail store, including their corresponding prices at competing stores. The key columns in the dataset are as follows:

1. **`Fiscal_Week_Id`**: The fiscal week identifier, indicating the time frame of the data.
2. **`Store_Id`**: A unique identifier for each store.
3. **`Item_Id`**: A unique identifier for each item sold.
4. **`Price`**: The price of the item at our store.
5. **`Item_Quantity`**: The quantity of the item sold during the fiscal week.
6. **`Sales_Amount_No_Discount`**: The total sales amount for the item, calculated without applying any discounts.
7. **`Sales_Amount`**: The total sales amount for the item after applying discounts.
8. **`Competition_Price`**: The price of the same item at a competing store.

This dataset spans multiple fiscal weeks, covering a variety of items and categories, providing a rich source for understanding pricing strategies and their performance.

## Problem Statement
The retail sector is highly competitive, and pricing plays a crucial role in driving sales and maximizing revenue. The current challenge involves creating a **dynamic pricing model** that optimizes item prices while maintaining competitiveness in the market.

The key tasks to address this problem include:

### 1. **Analysis of Current Pricing Strategy**
   - Examine the relationship between our store's prices, competitor prices, and sales performance.
   - Identify trends in sales and revenue across fiscal weeks.

### 2. **Competitor Pricing Gap Analysis**
   - Compare our store's prices with competitor prices for each item.
   - Identify opportunities to adjust prices where competitors may have an advantage.

### 3. **Dynamic Pricing Model Development**
   - Incorporate factors such as:
     - **Competitor Pricing**: Adjust prices based on how our pricing compares to competitors.
     - **Demand Elasticity**: Analyze the sensitivity of item sales to price changes.
     - **Market Trends**: Utilize historical sales data and seasonal patterns to predict optimal pricing.

### 4. **Model Simulation and Evaluation**
   - Implement the dynamic pricing model.
   - Simulate its performance on historical data.
   - Compare the results of the dynamic pricing model against the current pricing strategy to evaluate its impact on revenue.

### 5. Machine Learning Model Selection
   - Identify the best machine learning models for dynamic pricing optimization.
   - Compare model performance using key metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, revenue impact).
